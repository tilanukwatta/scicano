# SciCano

SciCano is a recommendation engine for scientific papers posted on the ArXiv.org pre-print server. The goal of SciCano is to let people find research papers relevant to the search text that they are looking for. The SciCano do this by clustering the papers according to their similarity and by matching the search text to a particular cluster. Unlike key word search, SciCano may come up with unexpectedly interesting articles that was not obviously relevant.
